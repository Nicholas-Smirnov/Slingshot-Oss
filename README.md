# Welcome to Slingshot-OSS!

### Where do I get started?

Inside of the website, it will bring you to an index.html. You can continue to sign up from there, or by logging in from there! In addition, there is also a discord link!

### How do I sign up?

Inside the sign up page, I also added a discord name tag so that if the person perhaps wins a challenge, they can get into contact through discord. And simply enough, a username and password is needed. After you sign up, it should bring you to a log in page.

### What do I do?

Inside the dashboard, if the OSS challenge didn't end yet, you will have the option to see more. Inside of see more, you can:

1. Add your name to the participant list
2. Check out current submissions
3. Create or edit your submission

### What happens after the timer reaches an end?

Once the timer reaches the end, it should disable access to see more, and it will only allow you to check out current submissions. A new part of the table will open up dashboard, and it should say winner. However if the winner is not yet announced, it should just say, "to be announced".

### How do I create my own OSS?

In order to create your own OSS, you will need access to the database. There, you may be change anything you want.

### Well that is it!

Thank you checking out my OSS submission! Hopefully you had fun!
